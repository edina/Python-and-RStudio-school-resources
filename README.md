# Python-and-RStudio-school-resources
This repository serves to host the teaching and learning content developed by EDINA, the centre for digital expertise at the University of Edinburgh, in collaboration with Education Scotland to provide continuous learning materials for use with the Noteable service. This repository hosts and organises these materials by programming language and level within the Scottish curriculum. 

# Guides, workbooks and notebook Exemplars 

This repository is for coding activities developed in Jupyter notebooks and RStudio using the Noteable platform (www.noteable.edina.ac.uk) for Scottish teachers and learners. These materials were developed between October and March 2022 and cover topics from the curriculum in Computing Science, Mathematics, Statistics and other fields involving data analysis. The content in these notebooks aims to provide support and learning materials for teachers to adopt and use the Noteable service across school in Scotland, to deliver curriculum topics involving the analysis of numbers, data or other types of information and programming elements at Scottish Qualifications Authority National Levels.

This content aims to provide support and learning materials for teachers to adopt and use the Noteable service across schools in Scotland and is supported by Education Scotland's ***Enhancing Professional Learning in STEM Programme.
