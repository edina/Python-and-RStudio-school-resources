    "Before you start programming the algorithm, you need to understand what could go wrong with the steps you’ve designed because computers are only as smart as you program them to be. There are several problems with this algorithm. Most notably between steps 2 and 3, where we try to replace the bulb. Did you check to see if the bulb was too hot to touch? In this case we did not, so anybody following this algorithm directly could get burned. As humans, basic instincts take over, and we would stop touching it, but computers will continue to perform the task they’re told. \n",
    "\n",
    "Other glaring problems would include checking the replacement bulb being the correct type, and what to do with the bulb that we just replaced. The algorithm doesn’t specify a step to dispose of it properly, so do we just leave it in our hand forever? These are steps we need to consider when replacing a bulb. \n",
    "\n",
